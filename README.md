# Emergent Models: Machine Learning from Cellular Automata

> A novel proposal for building ML models inspired by Turing Machines and Cellular Automata, designed as alternatives to neural networks.

## ðŸ“œ Overview

This repository contains the **full research proposal** for *Emergent Models (EMs)* â€” a new family of machine learning models that evolve large state spaces through simple local rules, inspired by biological and computational systems like Turing Machines and Cellular Automata.
